**_This is a work in progress_**

# eros

is a statically typed, general-purpose programming language. **eros** is being developed right now and must:
* Be easy to read and write
* Provide a fast and nice write-compile-run-debug cycle
* Be able to produce native code in any machine
* Have a small footprint (no runtime environment or virtual machine involved)

## Building

### *nix
It depends on ```libedit``` to be installed:

```
apt-get install libedit   # on debian
# TODO: add more distros here
```

To build just run:
```
make
```

### Windows

Just run:
```
nmake
```

The binary will be located at ```bin/eros```

## Testing

### *nix
```
make test
```

### Windows
```
nmake test
```

# Ideas to have in mind

1. Whitespace matters: `a := 123` is valid, but `a:=123` or `a:= 123` are syntax errors.
2. One tool to rule them all (compile, interpret, package management).
3. Automagic package management (if a package is not available ask to download).
4. Inmutability by default, mutability as opt-in but difficult to write.
5. Compiled and interpreted, also a REPL.
6. Strong typing but with implicit types: `Number a := 123` must be the same as `a := 123`.
7. Observer builtin (or pub/sub or something like that).
8. Multiparadigm: Functional and OOP at least (like python and/or js).
9. Closures.
10. First Class everything: Numbers, Arrays, Functions, Types.
11. OOP without inheritance, only composition (like golang, maybe?).
12. OOP without classes. (see Self)
13. Parametrized types (like List<T> or something like that).
14. Metaprogramming: If a type is first class we can create and modify types at runtime.
15. No implicit 'operator' precedence allowed: 2 + 3 * 4 should be illegal, you must write (2 + 3) * 4 or 2 + (3 * 4). But 2 + 3 + 4 is allowed (becasuse they are the same operator) (see Self)
16. EASY TO READ AND WRITE: "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." - Martin Fowler.
17. Hot Code Reload.

# Things to investigate

* Self: http://www.selflanguage.org/ (OOP without classes, with "real" objects)
* Crystal: https://crystal-lang.org/ (Ruby-like, Concurrent, created by Argentinians)
* Nim: https://nim-lang.org/ (System language that compiles to JavaScript and builds dependency-free binaries)
* Zig: http://andrewkelley.me/post/intro-to-zig.html (Implemented in C, with a complete C ABI)
* Lemon: https://github.com/lemon-lang/lemon (Implemented in C)
* Rust: https://www.rust-lang.org (Traits, Enums)
