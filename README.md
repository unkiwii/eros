**_This is a work in progress_**

**newlang** is an object-oriented, statically typed, general-purpose programming language. **newlang** is being developed right now and must:
* Be easy to read and debug.
* Provide a fast and nice write-compile-run-debug cycle
* Be able to produce native code in any machine (or in a large number of machines)
* Have a small footprint (no runtime environment or virtual machine involved)
