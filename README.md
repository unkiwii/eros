**_This is a work in progress_**

**eros** is a statically typed, general-purpose programming language. **eros** is being developed right now and must:
* Be easy to read and write
* Provide a fast and nice write-compile-run-debug cycle
* Be able to produce native code in any machine
* Have a small footprint (no runtime environment or virtual machine involved)
